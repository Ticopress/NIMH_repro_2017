*   As we saw in the previous lesson, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers.
*  The most recent commit of the working directory can also be referred to by using the identifier
   `HEAD`.
* Every previous commit can in turn be referenced by adding the `~` symbol and incrementing the number
    * So the most recent commit is HEAD, the previous one is HEAD~1 (pronounced HEAD minus 1), and so on.
* The diff command allows us to observe differences between difference versions of our working directory

## View differences between files

To see the difference between our modified files and our last commit we can use

~~~
!git diff HEAD 
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
output
~~~
{: .output}

We can specify a specific file for this:

~~~
!git diff HEAD metasearch_analysis.py
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
output
~~~
{: .output}

We can look for difference between to previous revisions too:

~~~
!git diff HEAD~3 HEAD~2 metasearch_analysis.py
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
output
~~~
{: .output}


We can also refer to commits using those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays. These are unique IDs for the changes, and "unique"
really does mean unique: every change to any set of files on any computer has a
unique 40-character identifier. Our first commit was given the ID
XXX, so let's try this:

~~~
!git diff XXX 
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
output
~~~
{: .output}

That's the right answer, but typing out random 40-character strings is
annoying, so Git lets us use just the first few characters:

~~~
!git diff X
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
output
~~~
{: .output}

Finally, a convenient way to search all versions of a file at once for a particular string is to use the `-p` flag for the `git log` command:

~~~
log = !git log -p
[x for x in log if 'clone' in x]
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
output
~~~
{: .output}


## Working with the history

All right! So we can save changes to files and see what we've changedâ€”now how
can we restore older versions of things? Let's suppose we accidentally
delete our file:

~~~
%save metasearch_analysis 15 # Type Y to confirm
~~~
{: .python}

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

~~~
!git status
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
output
~~~
{: .output}

We can put things back the way they were by using `git checkout`:

~~~
!git checkout HEAD metasearch_analysis.py
~~~
{: .python}

As you might guess from its name, `git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an
old version of a file. In this case, we're telling Git that we want to recover
the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`, which is the last saved commit. If
we want to go back even further, we can use a commit identifier instead:

~~~
$ git checkout HEAD~3 metasearch_analysis.py
~~~
{: .python}

> ## Don't Lose Your HEAD
> 
> Above we used
> 
> ~~~
> $ git checkout HEAD~3 metasearch_analysis.py
> ~~~
> {: .python}
> 
> to revert metasearch_analysis.py to its previous state. If you forget to
> specify the file in that command, Git will tell you that "You are in
> 'detached HEAD' state." In this state, you shouldn't make any changes. You
> can fix this by reattaching your head using ``git checkout master``
{: .callout}

It's important to remember that we must use the commit number that identifies
the state of the repository *before* the change we're trying to undo. A common
mistake is to use the number of the commit in which we made the change we're
trying to get rid of. Git messages written in the imperative help with this. 

If we want to go back to a version of our file before we started working on a
new feature that has not worked out and caused lots of bugs the commit message
"Start adding excellent new feature" is probably the first one to avoid and we
should jump one step further back in our history.


So, to put it all together, here's how Git works in cartoon form:

## Other useful points to note

* Remember to keep building up history's with the git lifecycle. When you
  finally decide you really need to use git to recover some code of many months
  ago you'll be grateful for your diligence then.
* [Learngitbranching](http://learngitbranching.js.org) is a great place to learn more advanced manipulation in git.
* Many editors have plugins to extend the functionality. Once you are
  comfortable with the basics of Git, they can really improve the experience of
  using git. Frequently the best way to use the more obscure commands is to go
  back to the command line though. Many times the only straight-forward
  solution is to a problem you are having is to type an incantation to Git at
  the command line.

The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.
