## Every value has a type.

*   Every value in a program has a specific type.
*   Integer (`int`): counting numbers like 3 or -512.
*   Floating point number (`float`): fractional numbers like 3.14159 or -2.5.
    *   Integers are used to count, floats are used to measure.
*   Character string (usually just called "string", `str`): text.
    *   Written in either single quotes or double quotes (as long as they match).
    *   The quotation marks aren't printed when the string is displayed.

## Use the built-in function `type` to find the type of a value.

*   Use the built-in function `type` to find out what type a value has.
*   Works on variables as well.
    *   But remember: the *value* has the type --- the *variable* is just a label.

~~~
type(52)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
<class 'int'>
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
disease = 'schizophrenia'
type(disease)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
str
~~~
{: .output}

## Types control what operations can be done on values.

*   A value's type determines what the program can do to it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-67f5626a1e07> in <module>()
----> 1 print('frontotemporal' - 'fronto')

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
~~~
{: .error}

## Strings can be added and multiplied.

*   "Adding" character strings concatenates them.

~~~
roi_label = 'fronto' + 'temporal'
roi_label
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
frontotemporal
~~~
{: .output}

*   Multiplying a character string by an integer replicates it.
    *   Since multiplication is just repeated addition.

~~~
dna_repeat_sequence = 'CAG' * 10

~~~
{: .python}
~~~

~~~
{: .output}

## Strings have a length (but numbers don't).

*   The built-in function `len` counts the number of characters in a string.

~~~
len(dna_repeat_sequence)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
30
~~~
{: .output}

*   But numbers don't have a length (not even zero).

~~~
len(52)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-f769e8e8097d> in <module>()
----> 1 print(len(52))

TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
~~~
{: .error}

## Must convert numbers to strings or vice versa when operating on them.

*   Cannot add numbers and strings.

~~~
1 + '2'
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-fe4f54a023c6> in <module>()
----> 1 1 + '2')

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
~~~
{: .error}

*   Not allowed because it's ambiguous: should `1 + '2'` be `3` or `'12'`?
*   Some types can be converted to other types by using the type name as a function.

~~~
1 + int('2')
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
3
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
str(1) + '2'
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
12
~~~
{: .output}

## Can mix integers and floats freely in operations.

*   Integers and floating-point numbers can be mixed in arithmetic.
    *   Python automatically converts integers to floats as needed.

## Variables only change value when something is assigned to them.

*   If we make one cell in a spreadsheet depend on another,
    and update the latter,
    the former updates automatically.
*   This does **not** happen in programming languages.

~~~
brain_volume = 1246
brain_volume_corrected = brain_volume * 1.2
brain_volume = 1400
brain_volume
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
1400
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
brain_volume_corrected
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
1495.2
~~~
{: .output}

*   The computer reads the value of `brain_volume` when doing the multiplication,
    creates a new value, and assigns it to `brain_volume_corrected`.
*   After that, `brain_volume_corrected` does not remember where it came from.
